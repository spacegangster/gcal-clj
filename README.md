Isn't a library yet.

A VERY early pre-draft for Google Calendar API integration from Clojure.
I see this as a pure REST client, with specs.

Architecture critique welcome.

I believe spec may be the most valuable asset here.
Anything besides spec isn't yet usable out of the box.
Specs may lack a couple of props, you can figure them out.
Fastest way to reach me is Twitter @spacegangster or email hello@spacegangster.io
